# fax

fax reports facts about where R is running and what it may actually use.

Inside a container,
[`parallel::detectCores()`](https://rdrr.io/r/parallel/detectCores.html)
returns the node’s 64 cores while the pod may use 4, and `/proc/meminfo`
shows the node’s memory while the container is limited to 8 GiB. Thread
pools sized on those numbers oversubscribe the CPU, and memory budgets
end in OOM kills. fax answers three questions on bare metal, VMs,
containers, Kubernetes pods and Azure, on Linux, macOS and Windows:

1.  **Where am I running?** OS, hardware, virtualization, container,
    Kubernetes, cloud, R and Python.
2.  **What can I actually use?** Effective CPU cores and memory, next to
    the host’s.
3.  **What is installed?** System, R and Python packages.

## Installation

Install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/pedrobtz/fax):

``` r

# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("pedrobtz/fax")
```

## Example

``` r

library(fax)
facts()
#> <fax facts>
#> os       macOS 15.7.9
#> runs in  no container
#> runs on  bare metal
#> cpu      host 6 | effective 6
#> memory   host 8G | available 2.5G
#> runtime  R 4.5.2 | Python 3.13.2 (system)
#> Use facts_df() for every fact with its status and source.
```

In a Kubernetes pod limited to 2 CPUs and 1 GiB on an 8-CPU, 32 GiB
node:

``` R
#> <fax facts>
#> os       Ubuntu 22.04
#> runs in  Kubernetes pod default/web-6b8f9-2xkqz, containerd container
#> runs on  vm (unknown)
#> cpu      host 8 | effective 2
#> memory   host 32G | limit 1G | available 824M
```

Size worker pools with what the process may use:

``` r

future::plan(future::multisession, workers = effective_cores())
data.table::setDTthreads(effective_cores())
```

Add CPU and memory use to log lines, cheaply (about 170 µs on Linux):

``` r

message("batch done ", usage_line())
#> batch done cpu=1.8/4 thr=3% mem=2.1G/8G(26%) rss=1.2G
```

Every fact records its status and source, and fax never fails: what it
cannot determine is `NA`.

``` r

head(facts_df()[, c("fact", "status", "source")])
#>               fact         status  source
#> 1        os.family             ok    <NA>
#> 2          os.name             ok sw_vers
#> 3            os.id             ok    <NA>
#> 4       os.id_like not_applicable    <NA>
#> 5  os.release.full             ok sw_vers
#> 6 os.release.major             ok sw_vers
```

fax makes no network requests unless you ask for cloud metadata with
`facts(cloud = TRUE)`, never reads credentials, and redacts secrets in
environment variables.
