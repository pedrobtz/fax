# Azure

fax recognises Azure without network access, and with `cloud = TRUE`
reads the instance metadata service (IMDS) for details such as region
and VM size.

## Offline: which service am I on?

`cloud.provider` is `"azure"` when the VM’s DMI data says so (Azure sets
a fixed chassis asset tag), when Hyper-V is combined with the Azure
guest agent (`/var/lib/waagent` on Linux, `C:/WindowsAzure` on Windows),
or when one of the Azure services below sets its environment variables.

`cloud.azure.platform` then names the service:

| Platform         | Recognised by                                |
|:-----------------|:---------------------------------------------|
| `functions`      | `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME`                   |
| `app-service`    | `WEBSITE_SITE_NAME`                          |
| `container-apps` | `CONTAINER_APP_NAME`                         |
| `batch`          | `AZ_BATCH_NODE_ID`                           |
| `azureml`        | `AZUREML_RUN_ID`                             |
| `databricks`     | `DATABRICKS_RUNTIME_VERSION` (on Azure only) |
| `aks`            | a Kubernetes pod on an Azure node            |
| `vm`             | anything else on Azure                       |

`cloud.azure.service` holds the service’s non-secret identifiers,
e.g. the App Service site and instance or the Batch pool, node, job and
task.

## Online: instance metadata

``` r

f <- facts(cloud = TRUE)
f
#> <fax facts>
#> os       Ubuntu 24.04
#> runs in  Kubernetes pod analytics/spark-driver-7d9f-xk2lp, containerd container
#> runs on  vm (hyperv), cloud azure (aks), node westeurope Standard_D4s_v5
#> cpu      host 4 | effective 1.5 (2 threads)
#> memory   host 16G | limit 4G | available 3.1G
#> Use facts_df() for every fact with its status and source.

str(f$cloud[c("region", "zone", "instance")])
#> List of 3
#>  $ region  : chr "westeurope"
#>  $ zone    : chr "2"
#>  $ instance:List of 2
#>   ..$ type: chr "Standard_D4s_v5"
#>   ..$ id  : chr "11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555"
```

`f$cloud$azure` adds the VM name, resource group, subscription, scale
set, spot priority and eviction policy, image, tags and IP addresses.
Tags whose name looks like a secret are redacted, like environment
variables.

In a pod, the metadata describes the **node VM**, not the pod: the
summary says `node` to make that clear.

## What fax does and does not do

- No request is made without `cloud = TRUE` (or
  `options(fax.cloud = TRUE)`), and none off Azure: the offline check
  comes first.
- Exactly one URL can be requested:
  `http://169.254.169.254/metadata/instance?api-version=2021-02-01`. The
  managed identity endpoints (`/metadata/identity/...`) that hand out
  access tokens are refused before any connection is made.
- The request bypasses any configured proxy, times out after 1 second
  and is made at most once per session, failures included.
  `refresh = TRUE` tries again.
- Where IMDS is blocked (some network policies, App Service, Container
  Apps), the facts are `unavailable` with the reason in
  [`facts_df()`](https://pedrobtz.github.io/fax/reference/facts_df.md).
- Parsing the response needs the jsonlite package.
